            <p> My website is here to share my journey of being a web developer. My working habit can make you impress
                to
                hire
                me.You might saw me jumping, climbing buildings, and stopping trains. But nobody pays me a dime for that
                work.
                That's why I am learning and mastering web development. I will not stop until I become the Web
